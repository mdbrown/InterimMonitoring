A thought on a next step is to evaluate the impact of interim monitoring. Specifically, suppose you monitor the marker-by-treatment, and stop enrolling if the CI for the interaction excludes the original design alternative (or specify some other criterion for early stopping).  If you simulate data under the null H0: no interaction, what is the sample size savings of doing this, versus enrolling the full N needed under a certain design alternative (say the weak simulated marker)?  If  you simulate data under the alternative (say the weak simulated marker), what is the power loss associated with doing the interim monitoring?  There will be some loss, hopefully minimal if the monitoring is done right.  Hopefully this is enough to begin thinking about, at least.
